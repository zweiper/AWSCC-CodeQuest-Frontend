// Working with Objects in JavaScript - Day 18: Assignment

// Task 1: Object Basics

// 1. Create an empty object named `book`.
// 2. Add properties to the `book` object for `title`, `author`, and `year` with appropriate values.
// 3. Access and print the `author` property of the `book` object.
const book = {
    title: "Ready Player One",
    author: "Ernest Cline",
    year: 2011,
};

console.log(book.author);
// Task 2: Object Operations

// 4. Create an object named `student` with properties for `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
// 5. Modify the `age` property of the `student` object to a different value.
// 6. Add a new property named `subjects` to the `student` object, which should be an array of at least three subjects.
const student = {
    name: "Jessica",
    age: 20,
    grade: 2,
};

student.age = 18;
student.subjects = ["Mathematics", "Science", "English"];

// Task 3: Object Methods

// 7. Create an object named `rectangle` with properties for `width` and `height`.
// 8. Add a method named `calculateArea` to the `rectangle` object that returns the area of the rectangle.
// 9. Invoke the `calculateArea` method and store the result in a variable, then print it to the console.
const rectangle = {
    calculateArea: function(width, height){
        return width * height;
    },
};

console.log(rectangle.calculateArea(5, 7));

// Task 4: Advanced Object Techniques

// 10. Create an object named `person` with properties for `name`, `age`, and `address`.
// 11. Use the `delete` keyword to remove the `address` property from the `person` object.
// 12. Create another object named `employee` with properties for `name` and `position`. Combine the `person` and `employee` objects into a new object named `employeeDetails`.
const person = {
    name: "Danielle",
    age: 25,
    address: "Marikina City",
};

delete person.address;

const employee = {
    name: "Pearl",
    position: "Manager",
};

const employeeDetails = {
    ...person,
    ...employee
};

// These tasks will enhance your understanding of working with objects in JavaScript. Objects are versatile and allow you to structure data in a meaningful way. Best of luck! ðŸŒŸ
